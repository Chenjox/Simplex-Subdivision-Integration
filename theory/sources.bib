  abstract = {In this paper we present a general, theoretical foundation for the construction of cubature formulae to approximate multivariate integrals. The focus is on cubature formulae that are exact for certain vector spaces of polynomials. Our main quality criteria are the algebraic and trigonometric degrees. The constructions using ideal theory and invariant theory are outlined. The known lower bounds for the number of points are surveyed and characterizations of minimal cubature formulae are given. We include references to all known minimal cubature formulae. Finally, some methods to construct cubature formulae illustrate the previously introduced concepts and theorems.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Degenerating tetrahedral partitions show up quite often in modern finite element analysis. Actually the commonly used maximum angle condition allows some types of element degeneracies. Also, mesh generators and various adaptive procedures may easily produce degenerating mesh elements. Finally, complicated forms of computational domains (e.g. along with a priori known solution layers, etc) may demand the usage of elements of various degenerating shapes. In this paper, we show that the maximum angle condition presents a threshold property in interpolation theory, as the interpolation error may grow (or at least does not decay) if this condition is violated (which does not necessarily imply that FEM error grows). We also demonstrate that the popular red refinements, if done inappropriately, may lead to degenerating partitions which break the maximum angle condition. Finally, we prove that not all tetrahedral elements from a family of tetrahedral partitions are badly shaped when the discretization parameter tends to zero.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In this paper, we are using two different transformations to transform the arbitrary linear tetrahedron element to a standard 1-Cube element and obtain the numerical integration formulas over arbitrary linear tetrahedron element implementing generalized Gaussian quadrature rules, with minimum computational time and cost. We also obtain the integral value of some functions with singularity over arbitrary linear tetrahedron region, without discretizing the tetrahedral region into P3 tetrahedral regions. It may be noted the computed results are converging faster than the numerical results in referred articles and are exact for up to 15 decimal values with minimum computational time. In a tetrahedral sub-atomic geometry, a focal particle is situated at the middle with four substituents that are situated at the sides of a tetrahedron. The bond edges are cos−1(−⅓) = 109.4712206…° ≈ 109.5° when each of the four substituents are the same, as in methane(CH4) and in addition its heavier analogs. The impeccably symmetrical tetrahedron has a place with point amass Td, yet most tetrahedral particles have brought down symmetry. Tetrahedral atoms can be chiral. Mathematically the problem is to evaluate the volume integral over an arbitrary tetrahedron transforming the triple integral over arbitrary linear tetrahedron into the integrals over a standard 1-cube using two different parametric transformations.},
